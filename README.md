Fitness Planner 
===============

Version Mock-up:
============

1.0:
* Nutrition Tracker
* Implement a "healthy food database" utilizing an API like Nutritionix.
* Workout Recommandations based on user's specific goals (lose weight, gain muscle, eat healthier, etc)
* Ability to sign up via Facebook
* Logo created, (I also need a formal name..... hmmm,) layout and interface constructed and coded.
   * My plan is to code all the design aspects in HTML/CSS; I feel that most of the design features in jQuery can be achieved in
     CSS3, and with less concern about compatibility.



2.0: 
* Create a blog with fitness articles.
* For exercise database, links to Youtube videos that show proper form/routine for workouts.
* Users have their own profiles, complete with progress statistics, such as: total calories burned, total weight lost (or gained),
  and pictures of their favorite health foods, as well as progress photos.
* Allow users to create their own "routine schedule," with the option of sharing it on your profile.
    *** By default, it will not be displayed on their profile, as certain users will be shy in sharing their routines.
* Facebook API will be in full swing, allowing users to find friends via Facebook.



3.0:
* Allow users to create their own fitness blogs.
* User created food database, where they can add dishes to the database that might not be their yet.
* Upon signup, users can pick one or more ultimate goals: "lose weight, gain weight, gain mass, gain tone, eat healthier."
  Their expierence will be tailored to those goals.
* A system to generate time-lapse progress videos based on multiple photos. The Google calander will have images posted to 
  certain days, making this process easier for the user.
